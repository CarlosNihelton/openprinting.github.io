As already back in [2019](https://openprinting.github.io/OpenPrinting-Microconference-on-Linux-Plumbers-Conference-2019/) we are holding a Microconference on the [Linux Plumbers 2020](https://www.linuxplumbersconf.org/), this year in ...

... the wider Internet!! Yes, due to COVID-19 it is all virtual this time, no travelling, no 12 hours with a mask in an airplane full of people. But also no nice sights and delicious restaurants, not tourist-guiding my co-workers with the help of my knowledge of the Portuguese language through a nice city.

But it has also one big advantage: It is much easier to get the desired speakers, as one does not need to get their travel funded. So we will have Michael Sweet, Ira McDonald, Aveek Basu, Alexander Pevzner, and Rithvik Patibandla on our virtual stage, and me naturally, too.

We will talk about the following [subjects](https://openprinting.github.io/upcoming-technologies/):

- [Printer Applications - A new way to print in Linux](https://openprinting.github.io/upcoming-technologies/01-printer-application/)
- [IPP scan (or virtual MF device) server (Scanner Application)](https://openprinting.github.io/upcoming-technologies/02-ipp-scan/)
- [3D Printing](https://openprinting.github.io/upcoming-technologies/03-3d-printing/)
- [IPP Fax Out - A new reality](https://openprinting.github.io/upcoming-technologies/04-ipp-fax/)
- [Designing and Packaging Printer and Scanner Drivers](https://openprinting.github.io/upcoming-technologies/05-designing-packaging-drivers/)

The conference takes place from **Monday, August 24 to Friday, August 28, every day from 2pm - 6pm UTC**. Our day will be the **Friday, August 28**, with our microconference to span all the 4 hours. Everyone is invited to visit us.
